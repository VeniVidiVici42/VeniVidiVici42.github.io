## Organizational work

In 2017, I founded the [US Math Competition Association (USMCA)](http://usmath.org), which
promotes math education through competitive events. In collaboration with student organizers at
Berkeley, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Duke, Harvey Mudd, Princeton, Yale,
and the universities of Florida, Michigan, and Virginia, we provide thousands of students 
with a year-long circuit culminating in a [national championship](http://www.usmath.org/championship).

If you are interested in contributing, operate a contest that would be interested in partnering with USMCA,
or have sponsor/press inquiries, please contact us at [director@usmath.org](mailto:director@usmath.org)!


## Problem writing

### Formal contests

In 2019 and 2020, I contributed to the USMCA National Championship. Those problems may be found
[here](http://www.usmath.org/championship).

In February 2017, I served as "Problem Czar" for the [Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT)](https://hmmt.co/).
That contest can be found [here](https://hmmt.co/www/archive/202).

In November 2015, I served as "Problem Czar" for the [Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT)](https://hmmt.co/).
That contest can be found [here](https://hmmt.co/www/archive/191).

In 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, I contributed to the 
[Joe Holbrook Memorial Math Competition](https://holbrook.bergen.org/) for middle schoolers. Those
contests may be found [here](https://holbrook.bergen.org/archive).

### Mock contests

Over the course of my high school career, I wrote a number of mock exams for fellow students to
practice with, most of which were shared publicly. That list can be found 
[here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c87553h1098130_compilation_of_useful_posts),
which additionally contains a number of other useful materials I (and others) have written,
including an AIME study guide.

## Personal results

I competed in many contests throughout my student career. Some highlights:

In 2015, I earned an Honorable Mention on the 
[William Lowell Putnam Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition),
finishing the top 85 of ~5000 participants. I wrote about the experience (before knowing the results)
[here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c87553h1171032_putnam_2015).

In 2015, I finished in the top 20 in the [American Regions Mathematics League (ARML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Regions_Mathematics_League),
known as the "World Series of math". Approximately 2000 students competed.

In 2014 and 2015, I qualified for the [USA Math Olympiad (USAMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad),
finishing in the top 50 of ~250000 participants. In 2014, I scored an 18/42, 3 points below the cutoff
to qualify for the [Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Program).

In 2014-2015, I served as captain of the Bergen County Academies (BCA) math team, which comprised about 150 students.
That year, we finished 2nd at the Princeton University Math Competition (PUMaC), 6th at the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT),
1st at the A* Math Contest, and 14th at ARML.

In 2012 and 2013, I qualified for the 
[USA Junior Math Olympiad (USAJMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad#Exam_Content_for_USAJMO).
In 2013, I scored a 26/42, 2 points below the cutoff to qualify for the 
[Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Program).
