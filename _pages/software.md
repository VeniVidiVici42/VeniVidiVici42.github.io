## Work experience

In August 2019, I joined [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com) in a mission to 
democratize finance for all. I currently work on the [Clearing](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2018/10/9/introducing-clearing-by-robinhood) team, where we
handle the lifecycle of a trade after it has executed in the market. We're hiring,
 so feel free to reach out to [alexander.katz@robinhood.com](mailto:alexander.katz@robinhood.com)!

In the summer of 2018, I interned at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) on the Deploy Infrastructure
team, helping shape the process through which thousands of engineers deploy thousands of changes to
thousands of different services every day. In this role, I designed an internal deploy pipelining 
service, loosely based on [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/), that was adopted by several
major Airbnb services and reduced deploy risk substantially. 
This project was featured on 
[Airbnb's engineering blog](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/introducing-deploy-pipelines-to-airbnb-fc804ac2a157).


In the summer of 2017, I interned at [Amazon Lab126](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Lab126) on the
[Alexa Prize](https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize) team, which operates a competition for 
universities to develop conversational AI. In this role, I developed
machine learning models to detect when socialbot responses could be considered offensive,
and developed a system to prevent them from reaching end users. The team ultimately
 produced a [NeurIPS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12900.pdf) based partially on this work.
 
 
## Side projects

In 2018, as part of a class project for MIT's Computer and Network Security (6.857), we
implemented a cryptographically secure stock exchange; i.e. one that encrypts certain order book 
information while maintaining the ability to cryptographically demonstrate the correctness of its
operations. Our [paper](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2018/project/Katz-Aiylam-Murty-SecExch.pdf)
and [implementation](https://github.com/plusgood/secure-stock-exchange) are openly available.

In 2018, I participated in a project to predict the outcome of [League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/)
matches based on the competing team compositions. We were [able to do so](https://github.com/mafhcow/LoL-Match-Predictor) 
with approximately 57% accuracy, well above baselines.

In 2017, I competed in [MIT Battlecode](https://www.battlecode.org/), a real time strategy game
played by competing AIs (we [open sourced ours](https://github.com/zobs/waterbuffalo) afterwards). 
Our team qualified for the final tournament and finished 9th-12th.
