It's difficult to express in words how deeply horrifying the situation in Minneapolis is. In previous high-profile cases of police brutality, one could at least construct a good faith defense (however flimsy) of the officers involved, whether through justification or some form of "never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence". In George Floyd's case, no credible defense is possible; there is simply no way to view the scenario as anything other than cold-blooded murder.

This case also serves as a stark reminder that no matter how apolitically we may wish to live our lives, to do so is to not only willfully ignore our impact on society, but also to overlook that many others do not have that option. To be clear, I don't believe that remaining apolitical is necessarily a moral failing, nor even necessarily irresponsible. But I do believe that while the vast, vast majority of people are "good" (for appropriate definitions of good; e.g. in this case "not for arbitrarily killing people"), their relative silence allows the remaining voices to dominate, which should be viewed as a conscious choice.

This did not begin with the murder of George Floyd, and it does not end with the arrest of Derek Chauvin. More are dying by the hour. Reporters are being detained on live television. But worst of all, the protestors that directly brought about this welcome (if small) step towards justice are being rewarded with arrests of their own, threats to their lives, and unreasonable bail levels. This is, quite simply, completely antithetical to the principles of a functioning society.

I'm sharing my contribution to the [Minnesota Freedom Fund](https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/) in the hopes of encouraging others to do the same. If you are capable of doing so, please consider matching this donation to this or [similar organizations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7QxOvtvRfHUoMWib8coGHSS8szENXzSjIZKpvp-gtA/edit#gid=0), and help spread the same challenge on social media when you do (viewing this as self-serving is a natural initial reaction, but if even one person takes you up, your impact is magnified). If you are not, encourage your friends who are to do so.

We can do better than this.
