Apparently we're doing tournament postmortems now

Had a very normal result at Cherry Blossom (6/9, equal 4th, performing at basically my rating) but obtained it in very strange fashion...

R1: Got completely and totally outplayed by a player bouncing off his 2200 floor. Can't even be mad about it -- engine says he played essentially perfectly in a very complex materially imbalanced position -- but this is my first loss against a player that low rated in literally years so that's pretty disappointing

R2: Pretty normal win over a 2200, though even this one wasn't so easy and I started to lose what little confidence in my play I had left here

R3: terrible draw with Foisor; had to survive a horrifying position with a decent amount of bluffing/trickery, then when I finally limped to a better ending I didn't adjust properly and just offered a draw. This result isn't really that bad or anything (Foisor is a good player and obviously I'm not going to always beat her with black, plus she ended up having a fantastic tournament) but this was the second game that I had zero realistic chances already :(

At this point I have 1.5/3 for one of my worst tournament starts in recent memory, so I decide to cut my losses and take byes in every morning round so at least I can have one game a day. This was the first time I've ever taken more than one bye in a tournament, but honestly it almost felt like cheating considering how well the remainder went...

R4: bye

R5: Another fairly normal win over a ~2250 player, but somehow I spoiled R+b+fgh vs. R+fgh with my rook BEHIND THE B PAWN (just dropped a kingside pawn for no good reason) and had to rely on a pawn race to win, which tablebases claim I even blew at some point via missing an incredibly subtle idea.

R6: bye

R7: this one I was proud of; managed to "defy a law of nature" by very smoothly outplaying Kretchetov with black from an apparently rather stable position. Also notable was the opening: 1. d4 e6!? (an attempt to avoid the trompowsky) 2. Nf3!? (an attempt to avoid committing to c4, retaining the option of the Torre) c5!? (again trying to stay flexible) 3. e4!? and suddenly we're in an e6 Sicilian which I'm pretty sure neither of us have played our respective sides of in our lives.

R8: bye

R9: so somehow I'm on 5/8 after this total disaster of a tournament, and because Justin Paul holds a like 4 pawn down queen ending all my prep is wasted and I instead get Zapata. This is pretty sad because I stupidly revealed some prep when I played him in the blitz tournament, and indeed he deviated very early to avoid it. I try to play normal moves but get a totally lost position in 15 moves with white, which I know full well is busted but try my best to bluff that I'm doing fine. Somehow he falls for this, and several inaccuracies later decides to give away an exchange rather than leave his pieces stranded, and somehow my technique was almost perfect from there on out.

Overall I think I actually played pretty reasonably; round 1 was extremely unfortunate but the rest of the tournament was a significant over performance. I might have to consider this strategic bye plan more often; somehow it seems to work super well in these swisses since you don't really risk having a good result going to waste. Interesting takeaways I suppose.
