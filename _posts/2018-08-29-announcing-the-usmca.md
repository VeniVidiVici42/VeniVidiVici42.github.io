Hello everyone,

After more than a year in the making, I'm extremely excited to finally announce the [*US Math Competition Association (USMCA)*](www.usmath.org)!

As some of you know, the [USMCA](usmath.org) is an organization I've been working on developing for some time now, with the broad aims of improving college-run math competitions nationwide. We do this along two major axes:

1. Developing technical tools for contests to use, e.g. for problem management and grading.
2. Organizing a "[national circuit](http://www.usmath.org/national-circuit.html)", to spur participation and increase the geographical reach of the math contest ecosystem.

I'll be mostly talking about (2) in this post, but if you are a contest organizer (or especially an aspiring contest organizer!), we highly encourage you to reach out to us for more about (1).

The USMCA national circuit works as follows: teams earn "circuit points" by performing well in partner competitions, and near the end of the year the top 30 organizations qualify for the USMCA national championship. This year, the partner competitions are:

* [*Princeton University Math Competition (PUMaC)*](https://pumac.princeton.edu/): November 17, 2018
* [*Caltech Harvey Mudd Math Competition (CHMMC)*](http://chmmc.caltech.edu/): December 2, 2018
* [*Carnegie Mellon Informatics and Mathematics Competition (CMIMC)*](http://www.cmimc.org/info): January 26, 2019
* [*Berkeley Math Tournament (BMT)*](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/): March 2019
* [*Math Majors of America Tournament for High Schools (MMATHS)*](http://www.mmaths.org/): April 2019

The [USMCA national championship](http://www.usmath.org/national-circuit.html) itself is a remote contest that can be taken during a one-week window in early May, with two divisions: Premier (top 10 teams) and Challenger (next 20 teams). The Premier contest consists of an 2-hour, 8-problem Olympiad style test, while the Challenger division consists of an 2-hour, 30-problem short answer style test. Both divisions admit teams of up to 8 participants. More details will be sent to qualifiers in late April.

I'll be around in this thread to answer any questions :) You can also contact us on social media, so please help spread the word!

<summary>FAQ</summary>

<details>
<summary>Q: Why a national circuit?</summary>
A: Currently, the team-based math competition world is rather fragmented, and there are relatively few achievement tiers for teams that are not realistically fighting for the top spots. Bringing in a national championship model as used in the *individual*-based competition scene -- e.g. MATHCOUNTS and the AMC series -- combats this issue quite effectively. It's much easier to appreciate "we qualified for the national championship this year!" than "we got 28th instead of 44th this year!", and importantly is easy for school officials to understand :)

Additionally, the national championship model makes it significantly easier to start a new contest, as the biggest hurdle -- attracting interest in a new competition -- is already taken care of! In combination with the technical tools we develop (again, if you're an aspiring organizer, contact us for more information!), the logistical load on running a contest is substantially lessened, letting aspiring organizers focus on the fun parts (like writing questions).

<details>
<summary>Q: Why is the national championship remote, and not an on-site contest?</summary>

A: We feel that, especially with relatively little notice before the school year started, it would be unreasonable to place further travel demands on organizations. In particular, the last thing we want is to "compete" with our very partners for participation! In our early years, we want to err on the side of accessibility.

In the future, we do plan to move towards an on-site contest, once we can ensure that all qualifiers have the means to attend.

<details>
<summary>Q: Do we have to do anything special to sign up for the national circuit?</summary>
A: Nope! Just participate and do well in our partner competitions, and we'll reach out to you in late April if your organization qualifies.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: If we participate in a partner competition, do we have to participate in the national championship if we qualify?</summary>

A: Of course not! There's no obligation to participate in the national circuit if your organization only wants to participate in a handful of partner competitions. In this case we'll give the spot to someone else.

<details>
<summary>Q: I run (or plan to run) a contest. How do I join the USMCA?</summary>

A: Great to hear! Contact us at director (at) usmath.org and we'll get you set up.
