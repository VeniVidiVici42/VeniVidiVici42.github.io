Miracled a decent 6.5/9 (+4 =5) finish at NAO last weekend, despite what seemd to be heading for another disastrous tournament. In the end, managed to tie for 3rd for $1220 and only lose ~4 rating points in the process, which is a decent exchange rate IMO. More importantly, this seems to be one of the few tournaments that actually attracts people in my rough age group, so I ended up enjoying this event a decent amount despite the mediocre result :)

R1 (B vs. 2062 FIDE; draw): I felt like I did pretty much everything "right" here; i.e. got out of theory early into a pretty complicated position, kept pieces on the board as much as possible, etc. But unfortunately this wasn't enough; my opponent found accurate ways to neutralize the game very quickly and I was forced to accept a draw around move 25. I did have one (albeit very counterintuitive) opportunity to take an advantage somewhere, but I'm not really upset at missing it.

R2 (W vs. Alexandra Botez; draw): In an amusing pairing my opponent went for a very early ...h6!?!? in a Rubenstein French, which in-game I felt was morally wrong and should be outright losing somehow. Unfortunately, while I found a rather spectacular sacrificial tactical sequence to punish the move, somehow I failed to consider what happened if the sacrifice was declined, in which case of course I was in a much worse/practically close to losing position... in 12 moves as White. Fortunately I managed to get away with offering a draw here, but not exactly a good tournament start.

R3 (B vs. 1535 FIDE; win): In a truly bizarre pairing somehow I was paired against a 1535 player, who also had 1 point so it's not like I was being floated up to the lowest 1.5 or something. I still have no explanation for this. Anyway, my opponent tried a very novel strategy of replying to h6 attacking a g5-knight with h4 (normal-ish), but failing to recapture after the knight was taken (???). Not much to see here.

R4 (W vs. 2155 FIDE; win): Many years ago I was preparing some piece sac for Victor Shen in a G/30 nationals or something. This was time not very well spent as I ended up playing Black in that game, but I knew someday it would come in handy, and 7 years later that day has come! 

In reality this piece sac is just really well-known and basically refutes Black's line here, but any time I can get a 15-ish move win, I'll take it.

R5 (B vs. 2110 FIDE; draw): Once again I got out of theory into a very unbalanced position early, but ultimately White's position was pretty solid all game. Towards the end I gave my opponent a few chances to mess up in time pressure, but he defended quite well and held the 2B vs. 2N ending (sorry to disappoint Jon Ludvig Hammer :()

R6 (W vs. 2315 FIDE; draw): Now this game was really interesting. As usual I misplayed the opening horribly and reached a close-to-losing position, but I was counting on a really unusual tactic to reach a position I thought was winning. Unfortunately, my opponent found an equally creative defense and left my position remaining in shambles, but I was able to salvage a perpetual nonetheless. Honestly I felt like I "deserved" this win for finding such a weird tactical idea, but by the same token my opponent deserved it as well for finding the rejoinder, so fair result I suppose.

R7 (B vs. 2236 FIDE; win): After what had been a struggle all tournament, it was a relief to get a really nice clean win here, culminating in sacrificing all my pieces and mating him on the board (on d4!). Especially after, as usual, completely bungling the opening.

R8 (W vs. IM Richard Wang; draw): After an uncharacteristically normal opening phase, we reached some fireworks in the early middlegame where I had the opportunity to capture on f7 a bunch of times exploiting an a2-g8 diagonal pin. Executed properly, this would have worked fine, but I bungled the move order and allowed my opponent to trade queens into a pawn-down but easily holdable ending. I was pretty upset at letting this one go, because a) it was my first real missed opportunity of the tournament, b) despite a terrible start I could've been back in contention by winning this game, and c) I was not looking forward to having an actual fight the following day :(

R9 (B vs. 2331 GM; win): After blowing the previous night, I honestly wasn't super invested in the result of this game anymore (winning on-demand with black seems harder when you can barely win with piece odds against a 1500), so I decided to enjoy a Vegas night while I still could and went out until like 7 in the morning. Somehow, this ended up being one of my smoother wins of the tournament; in a game more typical of my fantastic play, I was completely busted out of the opening, had completely unwarranted confidence in my position anyway, found miracle tactics to survive, and then just won the game from there when I finally had a playable position. I'll take it.

Overall, it seems I've somehow morphed into a fairly solid never-lose kind of player (I've lost like 1 game in 6 months or something), which is a pretty far cry from how I see/saw myself and is honestly a little confusing. In any case, USATE is probably next up, in which that kind of style isn't gonna cut it, so hopefully I'll figure out how to win games sometime before then!
