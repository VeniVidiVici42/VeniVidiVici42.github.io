From a purely rational perspective, the changing of the calendar is nothing more than a social construct; an agreement to demarcate the passage of time with a "1" rather than a "0" for a while. But time itself can be a funny little concept. True, 2020 may have shared a fixed number of hours with its predecessors, but it's presumably noncontroversial (or as close as one can get in today's world) to suggest that those hours were somehow -- in a strange, qualitative sense -- longer than we've grown accustomed to. If it is indeed true that "there are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen", then, well, 2020 has more than earned the title of a century. And so while it may not be rational, it's hard not to feel a sense of... pure relief, for lack of a better term, at the so-called year finally passing us by.

On the other hand, it certainly makes personal reflection substantially more challenging. As a silly, comparatively meaningless example, my last chess tournament was all the way back in February -- decades ago, by today's standards -- where I attained the rather minimal, but nonetheless personally gratifying achievement of going 6-0 at the US Amateur Team East (USATE). At the time, I hoped it would be an auspicious moment for my chess prospects; a catalyst for one last serious push towards the GM title before it truly became too late. Today, other than being the last time I left home for more than a grocery trip, I have nearly no recollection of the event whatsoever. Days started to blend together. Weeks too, after a while. And so I've come to realize that too much -- and paradoxically, simultaneously too little -- happened in 2020 to truly, properly reflect on.

It's a tangent, but I imagine society will ultimately face a similar dilemma. When we collectively look back, years and decades from now, what will we all remember? Will it be the obvious answer: COVID bringing the world to a grinding halt? Or will it be one of the other half-dozen events that would normally -- had they happened in any other year -- singlehandedly shape the course of society? Or, perhaps, we'll just shrug it off like a bad itch and forget this dumpster fire of a year ever happened. Time will tell; hopefully, we've got decades of nothing happening to figure it out.

Anyway, my main takeaway is that this year's edition of New Year's reminiscing offers comparatively few personal lessons. This time around, there's no good, bad, and ugly; there's really just... ugly. Instead, I'm focused on how phenomenally lucky I am that there's no "uglier" or "ugliest" bracket in that classification -- through a lifetime confluence of fortunate circumstances intersected with a fortunate period in human history, I'm able to weather this storm safely, securely, and without too much difficulty beyond a hefty bout of stir-craziness and a handful of depressive nights. I'm able to continue a fantastic job, with fantastic people, with a fantastic mission; one that, for all our ups, downs, missteps, and false starts this year, has ultimately given 13+ million people a fighting chance in a system stacked against them (yes, I know how cheesy that sounds). I'm able to watch hundreds of the brightest high school mathematicians in the country do their best work, as they inspire hundreds *of thousands* more to start the same journey. And in a culmination of human achievement that astounds me just as much today as it has every day for the last 20 years, I'm able to do it all from a keyboard whose left Alt key fell off a year ago (don't ask). Yes, I know how cheesy that sounds too. But you won't get the stars out of my eyes just yet :)

Reflection, of course, involves looking forward as well, and here we come full circle: practically speaking, there's little difference between today and, well, yesterday. The pandemic rages on, the outdoors is still lava, and -- at least for now -- it's anyone's guess when strangers will be able to stab us in the arm. And so, in lieu of traditional resolutions, I'm leaving myself with vaguer generalities: having learned what I truly value by observing what I've truly missed over this time, I know now where my priorities lie once the world reattains some semblance of normality. Here's hoping that's in 2021.

And in any case, 2020 wasn't *all* bad -- after all, I *did* have a 100% chess winrate :)
