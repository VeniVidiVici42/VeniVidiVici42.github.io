Especially for those who live in wealthy areas (and/or those with low minority populations), it's easy to view policing issues as problems happening "somewhere else". The reality is that the problem is everywhere.

Menlo Park's 2019-20 budget includes $21.5 million (~30.5% of the entire budget) for the police department. In comparison, community services -- housing & economic development (affordable housing), transportation, childcare, community centers & gymnastics, community events, and all libraries combined -- were collectively allocated $18.5 million. In one of the wealthiest cities in the entire country, if not the world, this is a shocking mismatch in priorities.

This absurdly inflated funding doesn't even get results, for any reasonable definition. The average officer earns $223229 a year (benefits included), nearly double the average household income in the city. Collectively, the 76.5 employees investigated just 104 cases (29 of which were classified as "serious"), solving only 28%. Obviously, this is not the only service law enforcement provides, but the world will go on with a few less parking tickets. In comparison, the average housing & economic development employee earns over 25% less than the average officer, yet the 3 (!) of them have funded 140 new affordable housing units.

To put it mildly, this is already absurd -- but it gets worse. In the wake of COVID-19, Menlo Park is facing massive revenue shortfalls, and needs to make emergency cuts to balance the budget. Guess which programs they're looking to target?

Police are universally overfunded, overdeployed, and dangerous to the public. They're used as a one-size-fits-all solution to any and all social problem: mental health services? Police. Bullying in schools? Police. Drug addiction? Police. A minority talks to a white woman the wrong way? You bet -- police.

If the police want to be a budget military -- the direction they've been headed in for decades -- that's fine. In certain situations, it's even valuable! But they then should receive the appropriate funding to perform that service, and that service only, freeing the remainder for actual social services.

Enough is enough. Divest from police.
