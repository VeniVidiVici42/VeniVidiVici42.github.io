and a 2400 [FIDE rating](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/2039796), making me the 7th highest 
rated player in California and 78th in the country. My most recent tournament was the [US Amateur
Team East (USATE)](http://www.uschess.org/msa/XtblPlr.php?202002171842-001-12885132),

## Organizational work

In 2015, I (re)founded the [MIT Chess Club](http://chess.mit.edu/) alongside fellow students
Andy Trattner, Jonah Butler, and Amir Cohen. Our first meeting had 5 members (including the 4 founders!)
and took place in a corner of the campus Dunkin' Donuts, where we shared two sets and a clock that
ran out of battery halfway through the session.

Over the next four years, we managed to:

* Grow membership to over one hundred members, ranging from complete beginners to seasoned grandmasters.
* Raise over $10k in funding to support our operations, attend local tournaments, and send teams to national events.
* Host 6 USCF-rated events reaching 281 players, 7 of which had never played a tournament before.
* Send competitive teams to national events including the US Amateur Team East 
and the Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship.
